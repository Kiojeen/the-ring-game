# The Ring Game
This is a game where you guess in which hand the ring is hidden. It is inspired by a game from the Iraqi culture called ```محيبس``` or ```Mheibes``` (more on that on [Wikipedia - Mheibes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mheibes)).

# Stack
I wrote this game in ```Vanilla JavaScript```, ```HTML``` and ```CSS``` as such a simple project doesn't require a framework to achieve.

## Objective
This project is meant to be an educational project for me to learn how to use ```Vanilla JavaScript``` after being stuck with react due to work. I hope you like it even if it's full of mistakes and classes. I was aiming to achieve this project with a very minimal usage of AI which was used only when I googled some ```JavaScript``` syntax.
